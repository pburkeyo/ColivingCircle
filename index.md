## Welcome to the ColivingCircle Blog

This blog will explore the new and wonderful world of coliving. 

The concept of coliving has fascinated me. I've been studying the rental market since 2014 and this is the biggest innovation I've seen in the industry. This blog will help us both understand what coliving is, why it's growing, what people love about it, where it's going and what it says about our society and economy. Surely, this concept of coliving sounds like a fringe idea, something my grandparents and even parents would scoff at. 

Today, it is rapidly gaining acceptance among people who not only see the cost-benefit value, but also recognize the social benefit and relationships that can grow faster than they would otherwise.
