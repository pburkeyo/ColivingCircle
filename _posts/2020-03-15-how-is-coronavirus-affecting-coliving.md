Coronavirus is changing the world as we know it.

It's taking a toll on nearly every industry, some more than others. 

The very nature of coliving is community and sharing, often with a large group of people, so my initial instinct told me this was going to shake up the industry in a negative way.  

"Everyone is in a state of panic, a few summer cancellations. Other than that we are good and providing all possible methods of precaution," said one property manager I talked to. 

Another echoed similar sentiments.

"People are freaking out. Some leaving, some without notice. It's been a lot of work to inform our team on the ground how to respond to fears. Pushing our members to mind their hygiene."

This is not too surprising, of course. The panic is widespread across every office or shared space in the country. Only natural for coliving, and likely, co-working, to be hit harder than other industries. While we all hope to wake up from this nightmare that has us glued to our homes and hoarding toiletries, we don't know when that will be or when these industries will recover. 

In an article by Gisella Tan in the [Bold Italic](https://thebolditalic.com/surviving-the-coronavirus-in-tight-co-living-spaces-da7fe18d9bea), she writes about how her experience overseas played a role in being more proactive about washing her hands, not touching her face and using disinfecant wipes on surfaces. She found that her roommates in the States weren't as diligent about preventing germs. Because nobody really knew the extent of what we were going to be facing, it was easy for people to write it off at first.

What should protocol be? We think it's best if people are overly cautious, for the sake of their roommates. You don't want to be responsible for getting other people sick so better to be safe than sorry, even if it takes a few minutes out of your day to wash your hands more than you normally would or clean something up with a disinfectant wipe. 

There is some good coming from the mayhem. 

Tenants in one of the largest coliving spaces in LA are seeing it as an opportunity to bond. "It's actually been really nice to be here during this crazy time. We're practicing social distancing, but we're all in it together!"

That's the one bright spot in all this; that it might deepen relationships for the better. 

As another property manager told me, "We hope to be having a good laugh about this in the near future."
