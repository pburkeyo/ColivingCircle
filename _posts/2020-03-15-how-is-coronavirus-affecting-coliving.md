Coronavirus is changing the world as we know it.

It's taking a toll on nearly every industry, some more than others. 

The very nature of coliving is community and sharing, often with a large group of people, so my initial instinct told me this was going to shake up the industry in a negative way.  

"Everyone is in a state of panic, a few summer cancellations. Other than that we are good and providing all possible methods of precaution," said one property manager I talked to. 

Another echoed similar sentiments.

"People are freaking out. Some leaving, some without notice. It's been a lot of work to inform our team on the ground how to respond to fears. Pushing our members to mind their hygiene."

This is not too surprising, of course. The panic is widespread across every office or shared space in the country. Only natural for coliving, and likely, co-working, to be hit harder than other industries. While we all hope to wake up from this nightmare that has us glued to our homes and hoarding toiletries, we don't know when that will be or when these industries will recover. 

As one of the property managers told me.

"Hope to be having a good laugh about this in the near future."
